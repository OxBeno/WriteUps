💡 Tip : How do you exploit reset/forget password endpoint !

scenario 1 :

1.create account , press forget password

2. Then, enter the victim’s email address

3. Intercept this request

4. Now, add your email also in the JSON body in request like this:

{“email”:[“victim@gmail.com”,”your@gmail.com”]}

5. Forward this request

6. Now victim and you will receive the same password reset link

Impact : account take over via reset password !

scenario 2 :

1- create account and go to reset password , don’t use the reset link now

2-change email account

3-return to use the first reset password link

Impact : misconfiguration lead to account take over

scenario 3 :

1-create account , reset password

2-go to reset link and change password

3-use this link again to change password

Impact : from this misconfiguration can take ATO and lead to Dos

scenario 4 :

1.) Open up Firefox and Burp Suite

2.) Visit the forgot password page

3.) Enter the victim’s email address

4.) Intercept the HTTP request in Burp Suite & change the Host Header to your malicious server

Impact : can you get cash poisoning or SSRF “ if the app trusts the Host header blindly “

scenario 5 :

1) go to [https://example.com] and login as user-A in browser-A

2) go to [https://example.com] and click on forget password in browser-B

3) change that password from reset link in browser-B

4) still you can see that session is valid in browser-A

Impact : maintain active sessions even after a password reset, allowing persistent account takeover despite credential changes
